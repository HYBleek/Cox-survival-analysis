* Cox-survival-analysis

The analysis examines data from 299 heart failure patients, focusing on patient characteristics and mortality outcomes. The dataset includes 13 clinical features such as demographics, medical history, heart measurements, and blood test results.

**Key observations:**

* **Mortality rate:** 32.1% of patients died, while 67.9% survived.
* **Numerical variables:**

  * Older age, lower ejection fraction, higher serum creatinine, and lower sodium are linked to higher mortality.
  * Platelets and CPK show no strong outcome differences.
* **Categorical variables:** Anaemia, diabetes, and male sex are associated with slightly higher mortality, while smokers had lower mortality rates in this sample.
* **Correlations:**

  * Mortality strongly correlates with shorter follow-up time, low ejection fraction, and high serum creatinine.
  * Moderate links exist between mortality and older age or lower sodium levels.

**Main findings:** The top mortality predictors are follow-up time, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine. Age, anaemia, and sodium abnormalities also contribute to risk. The results support known clinical patterns in heart failure, showing mortality is influenced by a mix of demographic, cardiac, and metabolic factors.
